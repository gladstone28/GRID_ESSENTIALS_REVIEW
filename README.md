## GRID ESSENTIALS

### Review

At this point, we’ve covered a great deal of different ways to manipulate the grid and the items inside it to create interesting layouts.

1. grid-template-columns defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
2. grid-template-rows defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
3. grid-template is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
4. row-gap puts blank space between the rows of the grid
5. column-gap puts blank space between the columns of the grid
6. gap is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
7. grid-row-start and grid-row-end makes elements span certain rows of the grid
8. grid-column-start and grid-column-end makes elements span certain columns of the grid
9. grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line
10. You have seen how to set up and fill in a grid and you now have one more CSS positioning technique to add to your toolkit! Let’s do some practice to solidify these skills.
